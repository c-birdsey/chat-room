# Chatroom Client and Server

Middlebury College CS315 Systems Programming- Fall 2018: This assignment implements both server and client for a simple online chat system. Every client will represent a user, which may have a name associated with it. Upon connecting, the name will be "unknown", but a user may change their name by sending the message "/nick <new nickname>" to the server. The server will announce the name change to all connected clients. Similarly, any message sent by a client will appear for all clients. The client can disconnect with ctrl-D.
